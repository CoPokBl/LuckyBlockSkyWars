# SkyWars Lucky Block

A SkyWars Lucky Block Minecraft game mode written in C# using
[Minecraft Dotnet](https://github.com/CoPokBl/MinecraftDotnet).

To play just run the program, connect at least 2 players to the server and
wait for the game to start.

Two maps are included, adding more requires code changes for now 
however a JSON configuration system may be added in the future.

This project is also designed to be used as a library, so you can
integrate it into another project. It is available as a NuGet package
`MinecraftDotnet.Game.LuckyBlockSkyWars`.
